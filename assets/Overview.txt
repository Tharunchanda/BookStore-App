BookStore-App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It serves as an online platform where users can browse, add, edit, and delete books. The application incorporates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies to create a seamless user experience.
